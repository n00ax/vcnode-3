# VcNODEv3
A complete rewrite of VcNODEv2, an automobile infotainment system [WIP]
## Whats New
VcNODEv3 is a complete rewrite of VcNODEv2. VcNODEv3, now features a CEF based thin client to serve pages from the frontend, and a completely Node based backend. The primary technologies for serving the frontend's pages include Mustache, Bootstrap, and JQuery. The backend primarly utilizes Node, MongoDB, and Express. This new client-server layout simplifies VcNODE significantly and gives a better streamlined UI
## Historical
VcNODEv1 was originally written in 2013, as a small prototype for a automobile infotainment system homebrew project. The project was originally implemented in C, and utilized a GTK+ UI. VcNODEv1 eventually became too tedious to manage, and GTK+ with it's limitations became a burden to streamlining the UI. In response to the former challenge, VcNODE was rewritten to become VcNODEv2, featuring a small CEF based (custom CSS/template) frontend with a C++ based backend. VcNODEv3, arose in the challenge to maintain the CEF client's interface with the native backend. 
## What's Next
VcNODEv3 is currently a work in progress, and the current development is considered unstable
